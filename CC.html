<h1>College of Culinary Arts
</h1>
<p>The Culinary Arts major is popularly considered the official “chef” cooking program.  Within Culinary Arts programs there are specialty distinctions like Culinary Arts–Pastry/Baking and others.  Whatever your chosen emphasis, the focus is on learning practical skills that will be applied in the kitchen.<br>
Most programs contain a healthy dose of theory as well, but the meat of a chef’s training comes in the form of real life skills that can be applied in a wide range of culinary employment settings.  Cooking school graduates are expected to display a mastery of kitchen fundamentals like knife skills and sanitation, and exhibit an understanding of classical cooking techniques.<br>
By providing a solid foundation, Culinary Arts degrees open a variety of doors for passionate food professionals.  Owner/operators are often trained in the kitchen before becoming restaurant entrepreneurs.  Cruise ships, casinos, resorts and other vacation destinations employ chefs in exotic locations.  Fine dining restaurants in metropolitan areas are often proving grounds for talented cooks.<br>
The scope of jobs is wide, and within each job category there are areas of specialization that further enable culinary professionals to fine-tune their careers.  The diverse nature of world cuisine provides the opportunity for chefs to focus on a particular type of cooking.  The pastry and baking distinction that many chefs aspire to illuminates another path for Culinary Arts school graduates.<br>
As a student, it pays for you to gain a general understanding of the hospitality industry and educational systems before putting your best foot forward.  A little research might bring to light possibilities for your culinary future that you did not imagine.  Understanding the hierarchical structure of professional kitchens and the training requirements for each job gives you the best way forward in attaining the education that is most suited to your ultimate employment goals.</p>
