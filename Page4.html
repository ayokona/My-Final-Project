<p>Following the recommendations of the Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, we are asking every student, teacher and employee who has recently returned from China, Hong Kong, Macao, Singapore, South Korea and Northern Italy (mainly the regions of Lombardy and Veneto), to stay off campus during the 14 days following their return. The IGS Group will provide remote educational tools. If you find yourself in this situation, please contact your educational referent.In order to manage possible contamination risks as best as possible, please abide by the following recommendations: cough into your sleeve, use single-use tissues and, above all, wash your hands regularly.<br>
In case you show signs of a respiratory infection (fever, or feel feverish, cough, respiratory difficulties), please immediately dial 15.<br>
These preventative measures, as well as everyone’s accountability, will make it possible to traverse this difficult time under the most favorable conditions.We are counting on your kindly cooperation.<br>
Please visit the Ministry of Solidarity and Health’s website on a regular basis for the latest updates:<br>

<h4>Program's</h4>
<p>2-Day Workshop Program
Homework: Individuals consider an "ideal teacher" description; groups assemble relevant science standards, endorsements, and required competencies for teachers at all levels. Readings are distributed ahead of time for jigsaw reading exercise.</p>
<h5>Day 1</h5>
Opening Session: Envisioning Your Program<br>
8:00-9:00 AM - Introduction to the role of Earth science in preparing future teachers with a discussion of what different individuals and departments contribute.<br>
9:00-10:30 AM - Identifying knowledge, skills, and dispositions of the Ideal Teacher : What do you picture when you walk into an elementary, middle, or high school science classroom where students are learning Earth science? Participants will develop a list of characteristics, first individually and then collectively. (Individuals or the group should choose to focus on one education level.)<br>
• Activity: Participants spend 5-10 minutes individually writing out characteristics of the Ideal Teacher on post-it notes. Then everyone puts their notes onto a board and the group organizes the whole set into clumps of knowledge, skills, and dispositions.<br>
• Activity: Participants consider and identify entry points for their role into preparing the ideal teacher. Discussion about roles, support, and beneficial collaborations.<br>
10:30-11:30 AM - Planning for Change: The facilitators lead the group through a Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis in the context of current challenges and the ideal envisioned in the previous activity. Do current program goals match characteristics of the ideal teacher?<br>
• Opportunities and strengths might include community assets, industry partners, school divisions, outreach programs, etc.<br>
• Connections to school districts<br>
11:30 AM-12:30 PM - Strategic Foci for Action Planning: A primary outcome of the workshop will be action plans for the program developed by the group through the workshop activities. The first section of this plan presents the strategic foci for the plan. Reflect on the opening envisioning activities as well as the reasons for requesting this workshop, then convert the list of key ideas into a final list of strategic foci for individual and programmatic action and record in the first section of the Action Plan.<br>
12:30-1:30 PM Lunch</p><br>
<p>Session: Aligning courses within your program to outcomes<br>
Jigsaw of important readings after lunch (spatial thinking, systems thinking, Science Teachers' Learning) and how they align with three dimensions of the NGSS<br>
1:30-3:00 PM - Earth Literacy Competency Alignment: How well do science content and methods courses meet the needs of future elementary, middle, and high school science teachers? Aligning courses to competencies can help the department visualize where students are or could be building their knowledge, skills, and dispositions that will help them strengthen their Earth literacy.<br>
• Activity: In cross-disciplinary groups, participants share with each other the Earth science competencies and course syllabi and make note of where they are aligned and where they diverge. Together, they determine where relevant science standards and expected core competencies are covered in coursework, where there are gaps, and where there are redundancies.<br>
3:00-4:30 PM - Highlighting high-quality, relevant resources: Curricular resources that address the competencies will be presented, with opportunities to explore the materials. Identifying and implementing<br>
• Criteria for selecting high-quality resources and examples of what has been vetted and how
 °Using rubrics to determine quality of resources (EQuIP, InTeGrate, CLEAN review)
 °Here are examples that meet these rubrics<br>
• Particular topics or subject ideas; there are different ways that resources are collected and curated:
  °CLEAN: reviewed and by topic
  °Dig Texas: brought resources together from many resources and packaged by a yearlong curriculum
  °InTeGrate: societal connection
  °Resources by provider<br>
4:30-5:30 PM - Tasks for action planning: What did you learn from the alignment activity that can guide your actions in the future? What curricular resources might you be able to use?<br>
Closing thoughts: Reflect on your role in teacher preparation as a whole. What have you learned about the connections to other course learning outcomes? Are there additional ideas that need to be recorded? Actions for the action plan?</p>
