<h1>College of Bachelor in Education</h1>
<p>The bachelor’s degree in education, sometimes referred to as a bachelor’s degree in teaching, is a four-year degree that can prepare you for a career in teaching and administration. All states in the US require candidates to hold at least a bachelor’s degree in education with appropriate accreditation and state approval in order to apply for a teaching certificate or license to teach in K-12 public schools. While the term “bachelor’s in education” can refer generally to degree programs that prepare prospective teachers, the major of the degree varies according to the subject(s) and grade level(s) the student wishes to teach. Whether studying online or on campus, most prospective teachers earn a bachelor’s degree in a specific area, which you can read more about in the majors and areas of study section. Other popular teaching degrees include career and technical education and middle grades education. In addition to researching traditional on-campus programs, prospective teachers may want to consider pursuing their bachelor’s degree in education online.</p>
